# Simple Setup Instructions

Upon first pull, open terminal and run `npm install` - This will install required dependencies
After dependencies are installed, run `npm start` and it will push to default localhost:3000
To deploy, the project must be built using the `npm run build` command, this will create an optimized version of the project in the `build` folder.

The module is broken up into 5 different folders:
API - This is where all the API calls are set, changing endpoints should be easy to do.
Components - Since this was a smaller app, I kept all my components in one folder, with one subfolder for Bootstrap components
Hooks - The useApi custom hook is here, making it easy to find and modify
Styles - All my SASS styles are here
Variables - All my SASS variables are here

Additional modules used:
React-Icons
Axios
React-Bootstrap

#Solution Discussion

There was a great article I found written by Ashraful Islam, published on BetterProgramming.pub - https://betterprogramming.pub/clean-api-call-with-react-hooks-3bd6438a375a
This article helped me develop a very clean, custom hook, for use with the provided API. The simplicity behind this hook makes it easy to change endpoints by editing a single file.
I choose to use React-Icons as well, to give a little more flare to a few items.
The tab setup was a great way to break up the information provided, and prepare for future updates such as filtering.

I struggled with whether or not to use React-Bootstrap. My CSS isn't sharpened, so I decided to add a toggle to show you both a version with and without Bootstrap. Mobile responsiveness is still something that I have been working on. I also couldn't get my tooltips working properly, to show what some symbols that I used meant. These are all minor things that I think just having another team member to shoot a question to would fix.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
